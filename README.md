## This is a fork that is intended to add folloving features to the original tarantula:
- REST API 
- more versalite jira integration

### Jira integration

Suppose you have Jira bug tracker set up and a test case execution with following results.  
1. Step1 - PASSED  
2. Step2 - PASSED  
3. Step3 - FAILED  
  
After choosing "Add defect to bug tracker" inside the "Associate defect" dialog tarantula redirects you to appropriate "create new issue" form with following fields filled in:  
**title** test case title  
**description**  
Preconditions => test case preconditions  
Step1 action  
Step2 action  
Result  
Expected result  

### Tarantula API

The REST API is used in the sense of doing POST HTTP requests with XML-ed params inside

#### Authentication

[Basic http authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) is used. Just provide a username and a password of existing tarantula user, who has enough privileges to perform actions below  
The credentials are transmitted without encription. If you need more safety please request for SSL support  


#### Create testcase
*Preconditions*  
- There is project "My project" in the system  
  
Following call will create new test case with specified parameters  

		http://username:password@tarantula_url/api/create_testcase.xml  
   
where body is  

		<request>
			<testcase project="My project" title="testcase title" priority="high" tags="functional" objective="testcase objective" data="testcase data" preconditions="testcase preconditions">
				<step action="Step 1" result="Result 1"></step>
				<step action="Step 2" result="Result 2"></step>
			</testcase>
		</request>

This method can be invoked e.g. for inmorting testcases fro a third party tool like testlink

#### Update testcase execution
*Preconditions*  
- There is project "My project" in the system  
- There is execution "My execution" in the system  
- There is testcase "My testcase" in the system inside "My execution"  
- Test step has at least 2 steps
  
Following call will update testcase execution setting run time to "1", step1 result to "Passed", step2 result to "Not implemented"

		http://username:password@tarantula_url/api/update_testcase_execution.xml  
   
where body is  

		<request>
			<project>My project</project>
			<execution>My execution</execution>
			<testcase>My testcase</testcase>
			<duration>1</duration>
			<step position="1" result="PASSED" comment="some text"></step>
			<step position="2" result="NOT_IMPLEMENTED"></step>
		</request>
  
The other possible options for result are: "FAILED", "SKIPPED", "NOT\_RUN", 
  
This method can be invoked e.g. for integrating with a test automation tool
